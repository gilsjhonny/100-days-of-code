# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent a while setting up the gulpfile for my calculator project for FreeCodeCamp so now I can work locally using ES6, SASS and BrowserSync. Also I did some refactoring, I still need to make a few more validations though.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled to make this work, but the good thing is that I can use this gulpfile as a boilerplate to my next projects. It was worth it.

### Day 2: March 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the calculator for FreeCodeCamp using jQuery and with a little help of ES6 syntax. I also joined 30Days30Sites challenge so I spent some time coding an Event Invitation using HTML, SASS and Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** Taking the dailycssimage challenge before has helped me a lot to be creative with CSS, I'm no longer afraid of playing around with positioning things.
