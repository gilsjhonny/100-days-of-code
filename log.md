# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent a while setting up the gulpfile for my calculator project for FreeCodeCamp so now I can work locally using ES6, SASS and BrowserSync. Also I did some refactoring, I still need to make a few more validations though.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled to make this work, but the good thing is that I can use this gulpfile as a boilerplate to my next projects. It was worth it.

### Day 2: March 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the calculator for FreeCodeCamp using jQuery and with a little help of ES6 syntax. I also joined 30Days30Sites challenge so I spent some time coding an Event Invitation using HTML, SASS and Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** Taking the dailycssimage challenge before has helped me a lot to be creative with CSS, I'm no longer afraid of playing around with positioning things.

### Day 3: March 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More practice with Flexbox and possible ways to animate it with a little help of JS, also keeping it responsive. The result was a Tourist Attraction site for D3 of 30Days30Sites.

### Day 6: March 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Polishing my skills with SASS drawing a pure CSS Arcade Cabinet. Feeling proud of this one.

**Thoughts:** I just realized that as a front-end dev if I want to step up my skills I should spend more time coding than designing so replicating or getting inspiration from Dribble shots is a great idea. (Credits given to designers)

### Day 7: March 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More SASS & HTML, I made a book site for 30Days30Sites Day 6 using my Arcade Cabinet CSS image.

**Thoughts:** Some css images are definitely not meant to be responsive, specially when you work with borders and percentages.
