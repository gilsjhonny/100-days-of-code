# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent a while setting up the gulpfile for my calculator project for FreeCodeCamp so now I can work locally using ES6, SASS and BrowserSync. Also I did some refactoring, I still need to make a few more validations though.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled to make this work, but the good thing is that I can use this gulpfile as a boilerplate to my next projects. It was worth it.
